## ðŸ›  Development Notes
- Codebase is in **C#** and uses SQLite for local data storage.
- Most report generators rely on the `tblsales`, `tbleod`, and `tblchecker` tables.
- Test cases should be run before moving any "ðŸ§ª Testing" modules to production.

## ðŸ“Œ To-Do
- [ ] Finalize `CSV_TO_XML` error handling for missing headers
- [ ] Replace `generated_palda_old` with calls to the new `generated_palda`
- [ ] Write automated tests for `generating_excel_presched`
